# Spam Message Classifier using Naive Bayes

This project implements a machine learning model to classify text messages as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam) using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm. The project uses the **TF-IDF** technique for feature extraction from text data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:
1. **Load and preprocess data** from a CSV file containing labeled text messages.
2. **Convert text data into numerical features** using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
3. **Train a Naive Bayes classifier** to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
4. **Evaluate the model** using accuracy and other evaluation metrics like precision and recall.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- **TF-IDF**: Text vectorization technique for transforming text into numeric features
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Machine learning algorithm for text classification
